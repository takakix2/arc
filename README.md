*`uv` for Ruby — with a time machine built in.*

## The Problem

Every Ruby developer has been here:

```
"It was working yesterday."
"What changed?"
"I ran some commands... I think bundle install?"
```

Shell history gives you *commands*. Git gives you *file diffs*. But neither tells you **what your environment looked like** at any point in time — which gems were installed, which Ruby was active, what failed and why.

**arc** records that story. Every operation. Every outcome. Every change.

---

## What is arc?

arc is a **Ruby project manager** built on **[Flux Core](#architecture-flux-core)** — an event sourcing engine for your terminal.

Think of it as `uv` for Ruby:
- **Isolated environments** per project (no more gem conflicts)
- **Global binary cache** (install once, link everywhere — like `uv`'s hardlink cache)
- **Blazing fast** Ruby bootstrap via pre-compiled binaries
- **Full operation history** — every `add`, `remove`, `install` is a structured, immutable event

But arc goes further than `uv`:
- **`arc undo`** — reverse any `add` or `remove` with a single command
- **`arc state --diff`** — see exactly what changed since the last operation
- **Zero PATH pollution** — arc never touches your system PATH

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/yourname/arc.git
cd arc && cargo build --release
cp target/release/arc ~/.local/bin/

# Start a new Ruby project
mkdir my_app && cd my_app
arc init .
arc bootstrap          # Download & link Ruby 3.3.6 in ~0.07s (from cache)

# Manage gems
arc add rails
arc add rspec --version "~> 3.0"
arc sync               # bundle install with binary cache

# Run your code
arc run ruby app.rb
arc run rails server

# See what happened
arc state
arc state --diff
```

---

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `arc init [path]` | Initialize a new Flux project (creates `.flux/` and `.arc/env/`) |
| `arc bootstrap [version]` | Download & link Ruby to the project (uses global cache) |
| `arc add <gem> [--version]` | Add a gem to Gemfile and install |
| `arc remove <gem>` | Remove a gem from Gemfile and sync |
| `arc sync` | Sync environment with Gemfile.lock (like `uv sync`) |
| `arc run <cmd> [args...]` | Run a command in the isolated project environment |
| `arc exec <cmd> [args...]` | Run any command with Flux logging |
| `arc env` | Show current environment info (Ruby path, GEM_HOME, version) |
| `arc undo` | Reverse the last `add` or `remove` operation |
| `arc state` | Show full operation history and statistics |
| `arc state --diff` | Show what changed in the last operation |
| `arc state --json` | Machine-readable output (pipe to `jq`) |

## Why Not shims?

Tools like `rbenv` and `rvm` intercept every `ruby` call via **shims** — thin wrapper scripts placed at the front of your `PATH`.

**arc never does this.** Here's why:

### The shim problem

```bash
# With rbenv shims:
$ ruby script.rb
# → Which ruby? rbenv's? rvm's? The system one?
# → Depends on PATH order, .ruby-version location, shell init order...
# → In CI/CD scripts, .bashrc isn't sourced → wrong Ruby
# → In VSCode, the terminal PATH differs from the integrated terminal
# → rbenv + rvm together? Officially "don't do this"
```

Shims are **implicit**. When they work, they're magic. When they break, they're a nightmare.

### The arc way

```bash
# With arc:
arc run ruby script.rb
# → Always uses .arc/env/ruby_runtime/bin/ruby
# → No PATH manipulation. No shell hooks. No surprises.
# → Works identically in terminal, CI/CD, cron, VSCode, Docker
```

> **"arc never touches your PATH. What runs is always what you see."**

This is the same philosophy `uv` chose: `uv run python script.py` instead of relying on a shim-managed `python`.

---

## Global Binary Cache

arc uses a **global cache** at `~/.arc/cache/` — shared across all your projects.

```
~/.arc/cache/
  rubies/
    3.3.6-linux-x86_64/   ← Downloaded once, linked to every project
  gems/
    gems/                  ← Compiled gems shared via hardlinks
    specifications/
    extensions/            ← C extension binaries (never recompile)
```

### How it works

```bash
# Project A: first time
arc bootstrap    # Downloads Ruby 3.3.6 → ~30s
arc add nokogiri # Compiles C extension → ~20s

# Project B: same versions
arc bootstrap    # Hardlinks from cache → 0.07s ⚡
arc sync         # Restores nokogiri from cache → instant ⚡
```

This is identical to how `uv` achieves its legendary speed — hardlinks mean **zero copy overhead** and **zero disk duplication**.

## Flux Core: The Engine Behind arc

arc is built on **Flux Core** — a general-purpose event sourcing engine for CLI tools.

│              .flux/signals.jsonl                     │
│           (Append-only NDJSON log)                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What is a Signal?

Every operation arc performs emits one or more **Signals** — structured, immutable events written to an append-only log.

```json
{"id":"019c70b2-2f24-7902-9f98-6548079e4fa5","type":"add_start","payload":{"gem":"rails","version":null},"timestamp":"2026-02-18T21:20:00+09:00"}
{"id":"019c70b2-3a11-7f01-b178-bd89a26ed073","type":"add_end","payload":{"ref_id":"019c70b2-2f24-7902-9f98-6548079e4fa5","success":true,"duration_ms":4200,"cache_hit":false},"timestamp":"2026-02-18T21:20:04+09:00"}
```

Key properties:
- **UUID v7** — time-sortable, globally unique
- **Correlated** — `add_end` links back to `add_start` via `ref_id`
- **Append-only** — signals are never modified or deleted
- **Structured** — every payload is typed JSON, not free-form text

### Why Event Sourcing?

Traditional tools mutate state and discard history. Flux Core treats every operation as a **fact** that happened at a specific time.

This enables:

| Capability | How |
|---|---|
| `arc undo` | Walk the signal log backwards, find the last `add`/`remove`, reverse it |
| `arc state --diff` | Compare Gemfile snapshots stored in consecutive signals |
| `arc state` statistics | Aggregate `exec_end` signals by command, count success/failure |
| Future: replay | Re-emit signals on a new machine to reproduce an environment |
| Future: AI audit | Feed signal log to an LLM to explain what happened and why |

### Flux Core as a Standalone Crate

Flux Core is designed to be extracted as a standalone `flux-core` crate — usable by **any Rust CLI tool**, not just arc.

```rust
// Any CLI tool can use Flux Core:
let project = FluxProject::open(&cwd)?;
project.record(SignalType::Custom, json!({ "action": "deploy", "env": "production" }))?;
```

## Philosophy

> **"Tools should remember."**

We live in an era where AI agents execute dozens of commands in seconds. Shell history isn't enough. Git diffs don't capture the *process*.

arc fills that gap — it gives every terminal operation **identity**, **structure**, and **permanence**.

Three principles guide arc's design:

1. **Explicit over implicit** — `arc run ruby` instead of shims. You always know what runs.
2. **Record everything** — every operation is a Signal. Nothing is lost.
3. **Project-complete** — everything lives in `.arc/env/` and `.flux/`. Clone a repo, run `arc bootstrap && arc sync`, and you're done.
